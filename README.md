# 🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Signal Management System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops an **AI-driven traffic management system** that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on **real-time vehicle density**. It **prioritizes emergency vehicles**, reduces congestion, and ensures smoother urban traffic flow.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
- **Real-Time Signal Adjustment** – Dynamically changes traffic light durations based on vehicle density.  
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority** – Detects ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles to enable **green corridor passage**.  
- **Accident & Event Handling** – Adapts signal timings for accidents, festivals, and VIP movement.  
- **Smart City Integration** – Supports cloud-based monitoring and analytics.  

## 🏗️ Architecture  
- **Traffic Sensors & Cameras** – Detects real-time vehicle count and type.  
- **AI Processing Unit** – Analyzes traffic flow and adjusts signals.  
- **Cloud Backend** – GCP Vertex AI for inference, Cloud Run for API processing.  
- **Traffic Signal Controller** – Executes AI-based signal duration changes.  
- **Frontend Dashboard** – Web-based UI for monitoring and control.  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language** – Python
